Using the previous assignment "Hook Form", add error messages.

If the First Name or Last Name is less than 2 characters, output an error message saying that field must be at least 2 characters.
If the email is less than 5 characters, output an error message saying the field must be at least 5 characters.
The passwords must match and be at least 8 characters.
These messages can appear right when you render the page, and will disappear in real time.

Hint: Use state and conditional rendering.
