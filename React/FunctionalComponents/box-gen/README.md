Create a component with a form inside which accepts a color. When the form is submitted, add a box to the set of boxes with the appropriate color.
 You may use whichever method of styling you prefer; refer back to the end of the previous module (React Components) for more information on styling. 
 The boxes should appear next to one another and wrap around if needed.
